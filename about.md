# About Me

Hi there! I'm a systems administrator by day, and... well, also by night. Some call it passion — others call it forgetting what sunlight looks like during a big infra rebuild.

I live and breathe all things IT. Whether it’s coding up something clever, deploying infrastructure like a digital architect, or just obsessively tweaking my home lab for the 47th time this month — I’m there for it.

## What I’m Into

- **Coding & Infra** – Python, YAML, Ansible, Docker, Proxmox... it's basically my love language.
- **Sailing** – Nothing like escaping civilization on a boat, only to SSH into a server from the sea.
- **Hiking & Skiing** – Because even sysadmins need mountains and gravity.
- **Sailing (again)** – Yes, it’s that important.

## Fun Fact

I turned my gaming PC into a Proxmox server.  
Why? Because I realized spinning up VMs was more fun than spinning up in *Call of Duty*.

## Let’s Talk!

If you ever want to chat tech, go sailing, or combine the two (floating Kubernetes cluster, anyone?), feel free to reach out.

Thanks for stopping by — may your uptime be high and your pings be low 🛰️
