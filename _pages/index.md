Welcome!
This is my digital workspace and nerd cave on the internet

Here you'll find blog posts about my personal and professional projects — from home lab chaos and Proxmox experiments, to coding adventures, infrastructure wizardry, and the occasional hike or sailing story when I leave the terminal.

Scroll down to see what I’ve been building, breaking, and occasionally fixing.
